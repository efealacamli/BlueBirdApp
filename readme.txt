===============
BlueBirdApp is an Android application that uses
Twitter API and twitter4j library. It has features
of user authentication, tweeting, showing home timeline 
and showing user timeline.
It is developed as a project for CSIT 333 Mobile Applications 
Development class in SUNY Fredonia with a team of two people.
The API level is 17. We tested this application on Nexus 4
and Samsung Galaxy Tab P1010.

HOW TO USE:
Click "Login to Twitter" button to login with your Twitter account. 
It directs to Twitter's webpage to authorize the application to use
the user's account. After authorizing the app, user can select the 
action by clicking the button for sending a tweet, showing user's 
timeline or showing home timeline. Clicking to Logout from Twitter 
button will be result in logging out from the user's Twitter account.

Twitter consumer key and consumer secret deleted on the project for 
security reasons. You need to put your own keys in order to run the 
code in TwitterConstants.java file.
